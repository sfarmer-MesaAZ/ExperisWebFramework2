# Experis Web Framework 2 #

EWF 2 is a major improvement on the original Experis Web Framework, and we decided that the changes were significant enough to warrant a new version number. Therefore, EWF 2 will be managed as a separate project from the original.

The primary goal in version 2 was to allow the framework to integrate into any existing HTML without the need to add design-specific class names like "size-3" and "two-column." With CSS pre-processors like Sass, we can now map common rules to any CSS selector through functions and mixins. For example, in the previous version of EWF, we would need to use a "three-column" class to organize elements into a 3-column grid layout. The framework CSS would apply styles to the "three-column" class, allowing you to reuse it wherever you like. But in EWF 2, we can apply the same styles to any HTML element, regardless of class name by referencing the element in Sass and using a mixin.
