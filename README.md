# Experis Web Framework 2 #

EWF 2 is a major improvement on the original Experis Web Framework, and we decided that the changes were significant enough to warrant a new version number. Therefore, EWF 2 will be managed as a separate project from the original.

The primary goal in version 2 was to allow the framework to integrate into any existing HTML without the need to add design-specific class names like "size-3" and "two-column." With CSS pre-processors like Sass, we can now map common rules to any CSS selector through functions and mixins.
